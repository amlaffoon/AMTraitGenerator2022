Features
- Used Flexbox to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views
- Created and populated a JavaScript array with one or more values and displayed the contents of the array on my page
- Created one or more JavaScript objects (such as with multiple values contained in { }â€™s), modified at least one value of that object, and displayed it on my site
- Created at least 3 variables (var, const, or let), set their values in JavaScript, and displayed the values somewhere on my page
- Created a JavaScript function that performs some form of mathematical operation (calculates something) and displays the result on your page or otherwise uses that value to do something on the site.
- Created a Javascript loop that dynamically displays HTML on my page

### To do:
-Polish the styling (font style, color, image placement, etc)

-Add more options when generating random traits
